## Custom code used for the analysis in Semenova et al., 2024

Custom code used for the computational analyses in Semenova et al. manuscript "Unbiased screening of regulatory insulators reveals their DNA sequence determinants".

The software and some additional processed data and files are provided "as is", in the hope that they will be useful, but without warranty of any kind. Please refer to the subdirectories:

-   `eve_BAC_screen` -- for the analysis of insulator screen of genomic fragments, obtained through tagmentation of bacterial artificial chromosomes ("BACs").
-   `synthetic_insulator_screen` -- for the analysis of insulator screen of synthetic library of wildtype and mutagenised potential insulator fragments centred on the CTCF motif.
-   `reporter_construct` -- for annotated GeneBank file, illustrating an insulator screen acceptor vector.

In case of any questions, please contact Maria Cristina Gambetta [mariacristina.gambetta\@unil.ch](mailto:mariacristina.gambetta@unil.ch).
