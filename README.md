## Custom code used for the analysis in Tonelli et al., 2024

Custom code used for the computational analyses in Tonelli et al. manuscript "Unbiased screening of regulatory insulators reveals their DNA sequence determinants".

The software and some additional processed data and files are provided "as is", in the hope that they will be useful, but without warranty of any kind. Please refer to the subdirectories:

-   `eve_BAC_screen` -- for the analysis of insulator screen of genomic fragments, obtained through tagmentation of bacterial artificial chromosomes ("BACs").
-   `synthetic_insulator_screen` -- for the analysis of insulator screen of synthetic library of wildtype and mutagenised potential insulator fragments centred on the CTCF motif.
-   `reporter_construct` -- for annotated GeneBank file, illustrating an insulator screen acceptor vector.
-   `MPM_script` -- for the design of point mutation in CTCF motif.
-   `SMF_cobinding` -- for the single molecule footprinting analysis at CTCF ChIP-seq peaks.

In case of any questions, please contact Maria Cristina Gambetta [mariacristina.gambetta\@unil.ch](mailto:mariacristina.gambetta@unil.ch).
